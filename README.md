An operating system made from scratch with a simple goal: providing an easy time for any user. This operating system will attempt to reach this goal by having a nice-to-look-at graphical interface, which will be following design standards that should provide good UI/UX.

## Why?
SpectreOS started because I got an interest in gaining a deeper knowledge of the workings of a computer. Operating systems are one of the closest programs I could think of, so I started doing research, and now here we are, with me attempting to create an operating system from scratch!
